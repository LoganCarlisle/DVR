# DVR
some differentiable volumetric renderer mainly built in warp and pytorch for now
kinda thrown together for now and just experimenting in the notebooks stage
idea is a semi-sampled cross between nerf and 3dgs i personally believe event driven architetures are the future however gradient descent is king so thats what im trying to accomplish through this architeture. A sparse event driven(at infra) model that can be used almost plug and play for linear layer or conv who knows what this grows into.
# Devoloment
-keep experimenting on diffrent larger benchmarks, test versatility 
-turn it from a whole bunch of notebooks to an actual library
-adding bvh--->hashgrids to train larger models
- add self adapting hyper param tuning as the models pretty sensative 
- temporal ascpect would be cool to implement
